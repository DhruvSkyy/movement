    This is a `xarray.Dataset` object, with the following dimensions:
    - `frames`: the number of frames in the video
    - `individuals`: the number of individuals in the video
    - `keypoints`: the number of keypoints in the skeleton
    - `space`: the number of spatial dimensions, either 2 or 3

    Each dimension is assigned appropriate coordinates:
     - frame indices (int) for `frames`
     - list of unique names (str) for `individuals` and `keypoints`
     - `x`, `y` (and `z`) for `space`

    If `fps` is supplied, the `frames` dimension is also assigned a `time`
    coordinate. If `fps` is None, the temporal dimension can only be
    accessed through frame indices.

    The dataset contains two data variables (`xarray.DataArray` objects):
    - `pose_tracks`: with shape (`frames`, `individuals`, `keypoints`, `space`)
    - `confidence_scores`: with shape (`frames`, `individuals`, `keypoints`)

    The dataset may also contain following attributes as metadata:
    - `fps`: the number of frames per second in the video
    - `source_software`: the software from which the pose tracks were loaded
    - `source_file`: the file from which the pose tracks were loaded

        Parameters
        ----------
        file_path : pathlib Path or str
            Path to the file containing the SLEAP predictions, either in ".slp"
            or ".h5" (analysis) format. See Notes for more information.
        fps : float, optional
            The number of frames per second in the video. If None (default),
            the `time` coordinate will not be created.

        Notes
        -----
        The SLEAP inference procedure normally produces a file suffixed with
        ".slp" containing the predictions, e.g. "myproject.predictions.slp".
        This can be converted to an ".h5" (analysis) file using the command
        line tool `sleap-convert` with the "--format analysis" option enabled,
        or alternatively by choosing "Export Analysis HDF5â€¦" from the "File"
        menu of the SLEAP GUI [1]_.

        If the ".slp" file contains both user-labeled and predicted instances,
        this function will only load the ones predicted by the SLEAP model

        `movement` expects the tracks to be proofread before loading them.
        There should be as many tracks as there are instances (animals) in the
        video, without identity switches. Follow the SLEAP guide for
        tracking and proofreading [2]_.
